# Nspire Movie Player

This is a movie player for the Ti NSpire CX calculator. http://youtu.be/Yx0L7ce5hq4

~~Precompiled binaries are available for download at http://www.omnimaga.org/index.php?topic=12855.0 ~~


## Status

At the moment, this is working for the NSpire CX. ~~Porting to the older models is underway (and should work but is untested)~~

Only a POC at the moment. More polish to come.

## What's the difference between this and nPlayer?

I haven't had a look since the start of 2011 at nPlayer but at that time, it looked like it couldn't run for more than a few seconds. The compression they used was run length encoding.

This player uses a public domain jpeg decoder to decode each frame and relies on jpeg compression to keep file sizes low. This has a performance penalty on the calculator (manages 9~10 fps) but significantly reduces the file size (especially for the CX where there's more pixel data).

I don't know about nPlayer, but a typical NMP movie file size is about ~2.86Mb per minute at 15fps.

~~Technically, this can also work with any image type supported by the stb_image.c file. This includes PNG images.~~
Only works with JPEG now to avoid checking image type every frame

## Compiling

Clone this repo to some location on your computer. Alternatively, download an archive and extract it.

1. Make sure you have a working Ndless SDK.
2. Go into the source code directory
3. Run ```make``` and it should compile everything.

## How to convert movies for this?

First you need the following installed on your host machine:
* ffmpeg
* A C compiler

You can simply run ```make helper``` then you can use the ```./convert.sh``` script and it'll do everything for you.

Otherwise, if you enjoy more control over the ffmpeg options, make a folder for all your frames. Then compile the helper.c program and copy the executable into your folder.

Change into your directory and run the following command on the command line:

    ffmpeg -i /path/to/movie -s qvga -an -r 15 frame-%05d.jpg

This will spit out a whole lot of files. When it finishes, run the moviecompile program and it will produce a file. Copy this to your calculator along with the main program and run it. Make sure the extension ends in .nmp.tns.

Enjoy your movie.
